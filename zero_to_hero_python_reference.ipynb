    "This guide highlights important Python programming constructs used in Andrej Karpathy’s **Neural Networks: Zero to Hero** lecture notebooks. It focuses on Python fluency – not neural network theory – and uses real code examples from the lectures to illustrate each concept.

    "## List Comprehensions\n",
    "\n",
    "A **list comprehension** is a compact way to construct a new list by iterating over an iterable (like a list or range) and optionally including a condition. It replaces the need for a few lines of loop code with a single concise expression. In general, a list comprehension looks like: \n",

    "```python\n",
    "[<expression> for <item> in <iterable> if <condition>]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This will evaluate the `<expression>` for each `<item>` in the `<iterable>` (keeping only those that meet the optional `<condition>`) and collect the results into a new list.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example – building a character index list:** In Lecture 2, Karpathy builds a vocabulary of characters from a list of names and then creates a mapping from character to index using a comprehension. Here’s a simplified adaptation that first collects all unique characters from a list of words, and then uses a comprehension to assign each character an index:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "words = [\"andrej\", \"karpathy\", \"zero\", \"hero\"]\n",
    "chars = sorted(list(set(''.join(words))))           # all unique chars\n",

    "print(chars)\n",
    "print(char_to_index)\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The result would be something like:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "In this code, `char_to_index = {ch: i for i, ch in enumerate(chars)}` is a **dictionary comprehension** that iterates over `chars` with `enumerate` to produce index–character pairs.

    "   - B. By using `ParentClass.method(self, ...)` or `super().method(...)`.  \n",

    "   Imagine you have a base class `Layer` with a method `activate(x)` that just returns `x`. You create a subclass `ReLULayer(Layer)` that is meant to override `activate(x)` to return `max(x, 0)`. Write the `ReLULayer.activate` method. Do you need to call the base class’s `activate` inside it? Why or why not?"

    "## Special Methods and Operator Overloading\n",
    "\n",
    "Python has a set of **special methods** (often called “dunder” methods) that you can implement in your classes to give them certain behaviors. We’ve seen `__init__` (initialization) and `__repr__` (debug printing). There are many others (e.g., `__str__`, `__eq__`, `__len__`, etc.). These enable operator overloading – redefining what operators or built-in functions do when applied to your objects."

    "1. **Printing Behavior**  \n",
    "   If a class does **not** implement `__repr__` or `__str__`, what happens when you `print` an instance of that class?  \n",
    "   - A. It will show a default string like `<MyClass object at 0x7f...>`.  \n",
    "   - B. It will raise an error because the object can’t be printed.  \n",
    "   - C. It will print all the attributes of the object by default.  \n",

    "   - B. It will call `__add__` once, with a tuple of all three vectors.  \n",
    "   - C. It will not work because Python doesn’t support chaining `+` for user objects.  \n",

    "This reference highlights the Python features you’ll often see in the “Neural Networks: Zero to Hero” notebooks. While these notebooks focus on deep learning concepts, the Python constructs themselves—list comprehensions, generators, lambda functions, `enumerate`, `zip`, classes, inheritance, and special methods—are crucial for writing clean, idiomatic, and extensible Python code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "By working through the examples and quizzes, you should gain practice in reading and writing Python that uses these features. Once you’re comfortable with them, you’ll be well on your way to Python fluency, ready to tackle deeper topics like backpropagation, model building, and beyond."
